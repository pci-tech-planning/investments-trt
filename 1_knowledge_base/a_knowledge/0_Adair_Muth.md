## Flagging Priorities. 
There is an application (Southside Well Water Storage - Harney) that requires a deeper review on whether or not it triggers the SVF requirements. They say they would use well water, but they seem to be using surface water rights that could be affecting STE species.

There maybe some language about surface water rights that contradicts the purpose of the application that describes using water from a well. 

There is a need to clarify if the project is feasible in terms of availability of water. This application would require an early review. 

Fco will do the inquiry for this project before Tuesday July, 16th at noon. 

First step should be done by?  Unclear. Yet, there would be two additional applications that are flagged due to issues with the water rights (Harvard PUID, Winston Reservoir).
